Notes:
- ETL vs ELT - looks like ELT is when data is extracted from source system, loaded into warehouse/object storage and transformed in data warehouse

Real life questions:
1) what is the file size youâ€™ve used? Reason Behind your answer. 
2) How long does it take to run your script in production cluster? How did you optimized the timings. Challenges you have faced. 
3) what was the file size for production environment? 
4) Are you planning for anything to improve the performance? 
5) what size of file do you use for Development? 
6) what did you do to increase the performance(in your project's Hive, spark)? 
7) what is your cluster size? Reason Behind your answer. 
8) what are the challenges you have faced in your project? Give 2 examples? 
9) How to debug production issue?(logs, script counters, JVM) 
10) how do you select the eco-system tools for your project? 
11) How many nodes you are using currently? 
12) what is the job scheduler you use in production cluster? 
13) Each node size? Code storage location?
